1- Manual Check:
	- Choosing random operations and calculating how many users used them.
2- Debugging:
	- Using break points and tracing the code functionality using F10.
3- Another File:
	- I took the first 20 records and modified the data multiple times to ensure that the functions were functioning correctly. 
	After that,I used the modified data with the same code and compare the output of the code with the contents of the file.
4- Breakdown Code: 
	- Breaking down the code into smaller units and trying to test each unit alone to see how it functions.
